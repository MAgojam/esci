\description{
Mueller & Oppenheimer (2014) asked students to take notes on a video lecture
using a pen or a laptop.  One dependent measure was \% transcription
(verbatim) copying, measured as the number of 3-gram matches to the text of
the video lecture. This data set is the \% transcription for the pen and
laptop groups.  It is suitable for estimating differences between two
independent groups for a continuous measure.
