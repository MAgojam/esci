various psychological and behavioral measures.
performance. Their first study (Damisch 1) used a golf putting task. Students
in the experimental group were told they were using a lucky ball (the Lucky
group).  Calin-Jageman and Caldwell (2014) reported two studies designed to
replicate Damisch 1. The first (RCJ 1) followed Damisch 1 as closely as
practical, although the participants were American rather than German college
students. The second (RCJ 2) made several changes designed to increase any
effect of superstition on putting performance.
138 U.S. adults, recruited in August 2018 on Prolific Academic, worked
online. First, they saw six fake headlines four times, each time being asked
to rate how interesting/engaging/ funny/well-written the headline was. This
rating task simply ensured that the participants paid some attention to each
headline. The stimuli were 12 actual fake-news headlines about American
politics, with accompanying photographs. Half appealed to Republicans and
half to Democrats. Later, 12 fake headlines were presented one at a time, a
random mix of the six Old headlines-those seen before-and six New headlines
not seen previously. It was stated very clearly that independent,
non-partisan fact-checking had established that all the headlines were not
true. Participants first rated, on a 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely) scale,
the degree to which to which they judged it unethical to publish that
headline. That's the Unethicality DV. They also rated how likely they would
be to share the headline if they saw it posted by an acquaintance on social
media; there were three further similar ratings. Finally, they rated how
accurate they believed the headline to be.
your heart rate? To investigate, Lakens (2013) asked students to record their
heart rate (in beats per minute) at rest before (baseline) and then while
recalling a time of intense anger. This is a conceptual replication of a
classic study by Ekman et al. (1983). Load the Emotion heartrate data set

To what extent does initial performance in a class relate to performance on a
final exam? First exam and final exam scores for nine students enrolled in an
introductory psychology course. Exam scores are percentages, where 0 = no
answers correct and 100 = all answers correct.
Data is synthetic to represent patterns found in a previous psych
stats course.
To what extent does being exposed to the American flag influence political
attitudes? One seminal study (Carter et al., 2011) explored this issue by
subtly exposing participants either to images of the American flag or to
control images. Next, participants were asked about their political
attitudes, using a 1-7 rating scale where high scores indicate conservative
attitudes. Participants exposed to the flag were found to express
substantially more conservative attitudes. The Many Labs project replicated
this finding at 25 different locations in the United States.
mathematics? To investigate, Nosek et al. (2002) asked male and female
students to complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT)-this is a task
designed to measure a participant's implicit (non-conscious) feelings towards
a topic. (If you've never heard of the IAT, try it out here:
tiny.cc/harvardiat) On this IAT, students were tested for negative feelings
towards mathematics and art. Scores reflect the degree to which a student had
more negative implicit attitudes about mathematics than art (positive score:
more negative feelings about mathematics; 0: same level of negativity to
both; negative score: more negative feelings about art). data_gender_math_iat
has data from two labs that participated in a large-scale replication of the
original study (Klein et al., 2014a, 2014b)
al. (2002), in which male and female participants completed an Implicit
Association Test (IAT) that measured the extent of negative attitudes towards
mathematics, compared with art. The study found that women, compared with
men, tended to have more negative implicit attitudes towards mathematics. The
Many Labs project repeated this study at locations around the world (Klein et
al., 2014a, 2014b). Summary data for 30 of these labs are available in Gender
math IAT ma. Higher scores indicate more implicit bias against mathematics.
See also data_gender_math_iat for raw data from two specific sites from this
replication effort.
Could eating much less delay Alzheimer's? If so, that would be great news.
Halagappa et al. (2007) investigated the possibility by using a mouse model,
meaning they used Alzheimer-prone mice, which were genetically predisposed to
develop neural degeneration typical of Alzheimer's. The researchers used six
independent groups of mice, three tested in mouse middle age when 10 months
old, and three in mouse old age when 17 months. At each age there was a
control group of normal mice that ate freely (the NFree10 and NFree17
groups), a group of Alzheimer-prone mice that also ate freely (the AFree10
and AFree17 groups), and another Alzheimer-prone group restricted to 40% less
food than normal (the ADiet10 and ADiet17 groups). Table 14.2 lists the
factors that define the groups, and group labels. I'll discuss one measure of
mouse cognition: the percent time spent near the target of a water maze, with
higher values indicating better learning and memory. Table 14.2 reports the
means and standard deviations for this measure, and group sizes.
Maybe you're thinking about buying a house after college? Regression can help
you hunt for a bargain. Download the Home Prices data set. This file contains
real estate listings from 1997 to 2003 in a city in California. Let's explore
the extent to which the size of the home (in square meters) predicts the sale
price.
Suppose you want to change the battery in your phone, cook the perfect
souffle, or perform a three-ball juggle. Just as numerous people do every
day, you might search online to find a video that shows what to do. Suppose
you watch such a video just once. First question: How well would you then
predict you could perform the task? Second question: How well would you
actually perform the task, the first time you tried? Now suppose you watch
the video many times: Again consider the two questions. These questions were
investigated in a series of studies by Kardas and O'Brien (2018). Let's first
do some quick analyses of Kardas Experiments 3 and 4-let's call them Expt 3
and Expt 4-focusing on the effect of watching a video many times rather than
once. In Expt 3, participants first watched a brief video of a person
performing the moonwalk. The Low Exposure group watched the video once, the
High Exposure group 20 times. Then participants predicted, on a 1 to 10
scale, how well they felt they would be able to perform the moonwalk
themselves. Finally, they attempted a single performance of the moonwalk,
which was videoed. These videos were rated, on the same 1 to 10 scale, by
independent raters.

Mechanical Turk, who are typically more diverse than students. The online
task was based on a mirror-drawing game developed by Bob and students (Cusack
et al., 2015, tiny.cc/bobmirrortrace). Participants first read a description
of the game and the scoring procedure. To play, you use your computer
trackpad to trace a target line, as accurately and quickly as you can. The
task is tricky because you can see only a mirror image of the path you are
tracing with a finger on the trackpad. A running score is displayed. The
final score is the percentage match between the target line and the path you
traced, so scores can range from 0 to 100
investigate, participants were asked to participate in a taste test. All
participants were actually given the same grape juice, but one glass was
poured from a bottle labeled 'Organic' and the other glass from a bottle
labeled 'Generic'. After each tasting (in counterbalanced order),
participants were asked to rate how much they enjoyed the juice on a scale
from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much). Participants were also asked to say
how much they'd be willing to pay for a large container of that juice on a
scale from $1 to $10. Load the Labels flavor data set from the book website.
These data were collected as part of a class project by Floretta-Schiller et
al. (2015), whose work was inspired by a very clever study looking at the
effects of fast-food wrappers on children's enjoyment of food (Robinson et
al., 2007).
The researchers were interested in how different study approaches might
impact learning. Working in France, they created three independent groups,
each comprising 95 adults. Participants worked online through seven learning
modules about DNA. The Reread group worked through a module, then worked
through it a second time before going on to the next module. The Quiz group
worked through a module, then had to complete a quiz before going on to the
next module. The Prequiz group had to work through the quiz before seeing the
presentation of a module, then went on to the quiz and presentation of the
next module. Participants received feedback and a brief explanation after
answering each question in a quiz, and could take as long as they wished to
work through each module and quiz. Seven days later, participants completed a
final test.

worked sufficiently hard to develop the requisite skills? Meta-analysis of
correlations can help answer such questions. The issue here is the extent
that practice and effort may be sufficient for achieving the highest levels
of expertise. Ericsson et al. (1993) argued that years of effort is what
matters most: 'Many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent
are actually the result of intense practice extended for a minimum of 10
years' (p. 363). This view was enormously popularized by Malcolm Gladwell
(2008), who argued in his book Outliers that 10,000 hours of focused practice
is the key to achieving expertise. However, this view is now being
challenged, with one important contribution being a large meta-analysis of
correlations between amount of intense practice and level of achievement:
Macnamara et al. (2014) combined 157 correlations reported in a wide range of
fields, from sports to music and education, and found correlation of only r =
.35 .30, .39. Table 11.1 shows the 16 main correlations for music, from
Macnamara et al. (2014).
brightly colored areas indicating which brain regions are most active during
a particular type of cognition or emotion. Search online for fMRI (functional
magnetic resonance imaging) brain scans to see such pictures and learn how
they are made. They can be fascinating-are we at last able to see how
thinking works? In 2008, McCabe and Castel published studies that
investigated how adding a brain picture might alter judgments of the
credibility of a scientific article. For one group of participants, an
article was accompanied by a brain image that was irrelevant to the article.
For a second, independent group, there was no image. Participants read the
article, then gave a rating of the statement 'The scientific reasoning in the
article made sense'. The response options were 1 (strongly disagree), 2
(disagree), 3 (agree), and 4 (strongly agree). The researchers reported that
mean ratings were higher with a brain picture than without, but that the
difference was small. It seemed that an irrelevant brain picture may have
some, but only a small influence. The authors drew appropriately cautious
conclusions, but the result quickly attracted attention and there were many
media reports that greatly overstated it. At least according to the popular
media, it seemed that adding a brain picture made any story convincing.
Search on 'McCabe seeing is believing', or similar, to find media reports and
blog posts. Some warned readers to watch out for brain pictures, which, they
said, can trick you into believing things that aren't true. The result
intrigued some New Zealander colleagues of mine who discovered that, despite
its wide recognition, the finding hadn't been replicated. They ran
replication studies using the materials used by the original researchers, and
found generally small ESs. I joined the team at the data analysis stage and
the research was published (Michael et al., 2013). I'll discuss here a
meta-analysis of two of the original studies and eight replications by our
team. The studies were sufficiently similar for meta-analysis, especially
considering that all the Michael studies were designed to have many features
that matched the original studies.  This data set does not include
two additional critique studies run by the Michael team.  See also

(2011). People who wanted to reduce stress, and were not experienced
meditators, were assigned to a Meditation (n = 16) or a Control (n = 17)
group. The Meditation group participated in 8 weeks of intensive training and
practice of mindfulness meditation. The researchers used a questionnaire to
assess a range of emotional and cognitive variables both before (Pretest) and
after (Posttest) the 8-week period. All assessment was conducted while the
participants were not meditating. The study is notable for including brain
imaging to assess possible changes in participants' brains from Pretest to
Posttest. The researchers measured gray matter concentration, which increases
in brain regions that experience higher and more frequent activation. The
researchers expected that the hippocampus may be especially responsive to
meditation because it has been implicated in the regulation of emotion,
arousal, and general responsiveness. They therefore included in their planned
analysis the assessment of any changes to gray matter concentration in the
hippocampus.
To what extent might choosing organic foods make us morally smug? To
investigate, Eskine (2013) asked participants to rate images of organic food,
neutral (control) food, or comfort food. Next, under the guise of a different
study, all participants completed a moral judgment scale in which they read
different controversial scenarios and rated how morally wrong they judged
them to be (scale of 1-7, high judgments mean more wrong). Table 14.7 shows
summary data, which are also available in the first four variables in the
OrganicMoral file. In that file you can see two further variables, which
report full data-we'll come to these shortly. Here we use the summary data.
After the results of Eskine (2013) were published, Moery and Calin-Jageman
(2016) conducted a series of close replications. We obtained original
materials from Eskine, piloted the procedure, and preregistered our sampling
and analysis plan. The OSF page, osf.io/atkn7, has all the details. The data
from one of these close replications are in the last two variables of the
OrganicMoral file. For this replication study, group names are in the
variable ReplicationGroup and moral judgments in MoralJudgment. (You may need
to scroll right to see these variables.)
skills? To investigate, Burgmer and Englich (2012) assigned German
participants to either power or control conditions and then asked them to
play golf (Experiment 1) or darts (Experiment 2). They found that
participants manipulated to feel powerful performed substantially better than
those in the control condition. To study this finding further, Cusack et al.
(2015) conducted five replications in the United States. Across these
replications they tried different ways of manipulating power, different types
of tasks (golf, mirror tracing, and a cognitive task), different levels of
difficulty, and different types of participant pools (undergraduates and
online). Summary data from all seven studies are available in
PowerPerformance ma.
reassurance, or, instead, encouragement and challenge? Carol Dweck and her
colleagues have investigated many such questions about how people respond to
different types of feedback. My next example comes from Dweck's research
group and illustrates data analysis that starts with the full data, rather
than only summary statistics. Rattan et al. (2012) asked their college
student participants to imagine they were undertaking a mathematics course
and had just received a low score (65%) on the first test of the year.
Participants were assigned randomly into three groups, which received
different feedback along with the low score. The Comfort group received
positive encouragement and also reassurance, the Challenge group received
positive encouragement and also challenge, and the Control group received
just the positive encouragement. Participants then responded to a range of
questions about how they felt about the course and their professor. I'll
discuss data for their ratings of their own motivation toward mathematics,
made after they had received the feedback.
childhood? To investigate, a large international sample of children was asked
to play a game in which they were given 10 stickers but then asked if they
would give some of these stickers away to another child who had not been able
to be tested that day. The number of stickers donated was considered a
measure of altruistic sharing. In addition, the parents of each child
reported the family's religion. Summary data provided.
has data from a large online survey in which participants were asked to
report, on a scale from 0 to 100, their belief in the existence of God.  Age
was also reported.
explanations of the material they are studying. Self-explaining has generally
been found to be more effective than standard studying, but it may also take
more time. This raises the question of whether it's the study strategy or the
extra time that benefits learning. To explore this issue, grade school
children took a pretest of mathematics conceptual knowledge, studied
mathematics problems, and then took a similar posttest (McEldoon et al.,
2013). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two study conditions:
normal study + more practice (More Practice group), or self-explaining
(Self-Explain group). The first condition was intended to make time spent
learning to be similar for the two groups. You can find part of the data from
this study in SelfExplain, the scores being percent correct.
program, and now it's your job to develop the ad campaign. Should you choose
a BeforeAfter pair of pictures, as in Figure 14.1, top panel? Or might a
Progressive sequence of pictures of the same person, as in the bottom panel,
be more effective? Pause, think, and discuss. Which would you choose, and
why? You might think that BeforeAfter is simpler and more dramatic. On the
other hand, Progressive highlights the steady improvement that you claim the
program will deliver. You're probably not surprised to learn that BeforeAfter
is used often and has long been a favorite of the advertising industry,
whereas Progressive is used only rarely. Luca Cian and colleagues (Cian et
al., 2020) were curious to know the extent to which BeforeAfter is actually
more effective, appealing, and credible than Progressive, or, indeed, whether
Progressive might score more highly. They reported seven studies of various
aspects of that question. I'll focus on their Study 2, in which they used
three independent groups to compare all three conditions illustrated in
Figure 14.1. The BeforeAfterInfo condition, in the middle panel, comprises
three BeforeAfter pairs, thus providing extra information about the before
and after endpoints. The researchers included this condition in case any
advantage of Progressive might stem simply from having more images, rather
than because it illustrates a clear progressive sequence. They randomly
assigned 213 participants from MTurk to one of the three groups. Participants
were asked to 'imagine that you have decided to lose some weight', then saw
one of the three ads for a weight loss program called MRMDiets. They then
answered the question 'How would you evaluate MRMDiets?' by choosing a 1-7
response on several scales, including Unlikeable-Likable,
Ineffective-Effective, and Not credible-Credible. The researchers averaged
six such scores to give an overall Credibility score, on the 1-7 scale, with
7 being the most credible. Simmons and Nelson (2020) were sufficiently
intrigued to carry out two substantial very close replications. With the
cooperation of the original researchers, they used the same materials and
procedure. They used much larger groups and preregistered their research
plan, including data analysis plan. I'll focus on their first replication, in
which 761 participants from MTurk were randomized to the three groups.
decided to examine the extent to which sleep relates to attractiveness. Each
of 70 college students self-reported the amount of sleep they had the night
before. In addition, a photograph was taken of each participant and rated for
attractiveness on a scale from 1 to 10 by two judges of the opposite gender.
The average rating score was used. You can download this data set (Sleep
Beauty) from the book website.
Stickgold et al. (2000) found that, remarkably, performance on a visual
discrimination task actually improved over the 48-96 hours after initial
training, even without practice during that time. However, what if
participants were sleep deprived during that period? They trained 11
participants in that new skill, then all were sleep deprived. The data were
(-14.7, -10.7, -10.7, 2.2, 2.4, 4.5, 7.2, 9.6, 10, 21.3, 21.8)-or download
the Stickgold data set from the book website. The data are the changes in
performance scores from immediately after training to after the night without
sleep: 0 represents no change, positive scores represent improvement, and
negative scores represent decline. Data set courtesy of

To what extent does study strategy influence learning? To investigate,
psychology students were randomly assigned to three groups and asked to learn
biology facts using one of three different strategies: a) Self-Explain
(explaining for each fact what new knowledge is gained and how it relates to
what is already known), b) Elab Interrogation (elaborative interrogation:
stating for each fact why it makes sense), or c) Repetition Control (stating
each fact over and over). After studying, students took a 25-point
fill-the-blank test (O'Reilly et al., 1998)
were interested in ways to enhance students' critical thinking. They were
investigating argument mapping, which is a promising way to use diagrams to
represent the structure of arguments. Students in their study completed an
established test of critical thinking (the Pretest), then a critical thinking
course based on argument mapping, then a second version of the test (the
Posttest).
might these factors cause aggressive behavior? To explore, Hilgard (2015)
asked male participants to play one of four versions of a video game for 15
minutes. The game was customized so that it could vary in violence (shooting
zombies or helping aliens) and difficulty (targets controlled by tough AI or
dumb AI). After the game, players were provoked by being given an insulting
evaluation by a confederate. Participants then got to decide how long the
confederate should hold their hand in painfully cold ice water (between 0 and
80 seconds), and this was taken as a measure of aggressive behavior. You can
find the materials and analysis plan for this study on the Open Science
Framework: osf. io/cwenz. This is a simplified version of the full data set."><title>also promote kind, altruistic behavior. Brethel-Haurwitz and Marsh (2014)
examined this idea by collecting data on U.S. states. A Gallup poll in 2010
was used to measure each state's well-being index, a measure of mean
happiness for the state's residents on a scale from 0 to 100. Next, a kidney
donation database for 1999-2010 was used to figure out each state's rate
(number of donations per 1 million people) of non-directed kidney
donations-that's giving one kidney to a stranger, an extremely generous and
altruistic thing to do!
their classic study, Jacowitz and Kahneman (1995) asked participants to
estimate how many babies are born each day in the United States. Participants
were given either a low anchor (more than 100 babies/day) or a high anchor
(less than 50,000 babies/day). Those who saw the low anchor estimated many
fewer births/day than those who saw the high anchor, which suggests that the
wording can have a profound influence. The correct answer, as it happens, is
~11,000 births/day in 2014. To investigate the extent that these results are
replicable, the Many Labs project repeated this classic study at many
different labs around the world. You can find the summary data for 30 of
these labs in the Anchor Estimate ma data file
numerous other issues can be highly damaging, but are thriving in this social
media age. Trying to debunk a conspiracy theory by presenting facts and
evidence often doesn't work, alas. Psychological inoculation, also similar to
prebunking, presents a mild form of misinformation, preferably with
explanation, in the hope of building resistance to real-life fake news-a sort
of vaccine for fake news. The Bad News game is a spin-off from research on
psychological inoculation. Basol et al. (2020) assessed the possible
effectiveness of this game as a fake news vaccine. At getbadnews.com you can
click 'About' for information, or just start playing the game- it's easy and
maybe even fun. You encounter mock Twitter (now X) fake news messages that
illustrate common strategies for making fake news memorable or believable.
You make choices between messages and decide which ones to 'forward' as you
try to spread fake news while building your credibility score and number of
'followers'-rather like real life for a conspiracy theorist wanting to spread
the word. Compete with your friends for credibility and number of followers.
Basol's online participants first saw 18 fictitious fake news tweets and
rated each for reliability (accuracy, believability), and also rated their
confidence in that reliability rating. Both ratings were on a 1 to 7 scale.
Those in the BadNews group then played the game for 15 minutes, whereas those
in the Control group played Tetris. Then all once again gave reliability and
confidence ratings for the 18 tweets.
decade earlier, had been one of several outside experts invited to scrutinize
the laboratory and experimental procedures of parapsychology researcher
Charles Honorton. Bem not only judged them adequate, but joined the research
effort and became a coauthor with Honorton. Bem and Honorton (1994) first
reviewed early ganzfeld studies and described how the experimental procedure
had been improved to reduce the chance that results could be influenced by
various possible biases, or leakages of information from sender to receiver.
For example, the randomization procedure was carried out automatically by
computer, and all stimuli were presented under computer control. Bem and
Honorton then presented data from studies conducted with the improved
procedure. Table 13.1 presents basic data from 10 studies reported by Bem and
Honorton (1994). Participants each made a single judgment, so in Pilot 1, for
example, 22 participants responded, with 8 of them giving a correct response.
Three pilot studies helped refine the procedures, then four studies used
novice receivers. Study 5 used 20 students of music, drama, or dance as
receivers, in response to suggestions that creative people might be more
likely to show telepathy. Studies 6 and 7 used receivers who had participated
in an earlier study. The proportion of hits expected by chance is .25, and
Table 13.1 shows that all but Study 1 found proportions higher than .25.

Some researchers claim that moral judgments are based not only on rational
considerations but also on one's current emotional state. To what extent can
recent emotional experiences influence moral judgments? Schnall et al. (2008)
examined this question by manipulating feelings of cleanliness and purity and
then observing the extent that this changes how harshly participants judge
the morality of others. Inscho Study 1, Schnall et al. asked participants to
complete a word scramble task with either neutral words (neutral prime) or
words related to cleanliness (cleanliness prime). All students then completed
a set of moral judgments about controversial scenarios: Moral judgment is the
average of six items, each rated on a scale from 0 to 9, with high meaning

their classic study, Jacowitz and Kahneman (1995) asked participants to
estimate how many babies are born each day in the United States. Participants
were given either a low anchor (more than 100 babies/day) or a high anchor
(less than 50,000 babies/day). Those who saw the low anchor estimated many
fewer births/day than those who saw the high anchor, which suggests that the
wording can have a profound influence. The correct answer, as it happens, is
~11,000 births/day in 2014. To investigate the extent that these results are
replicable, the Many Labs project repeated this classic study at many
different labs around the world. You can find the summary data for 30 of
these labs in the Anchor Estimate ma data file
numerous other issues can be highly damaging, but are thriving in this social
media age. Trying to debunk a conspiracy theory by presenting facts and
evidence often doesn't work, alas. Psychological inoculation, also similar to
prebunking, presents a mild form of misinformation, preferably with
explanation, in the hope of building resistance to real-life fake news-a sort
of vaccine for fake news. The Bad News game is a spin-off from research on
psychological inoculation. Basol et al. (2020) assessed the possible
effectiveness of this game as a fake news vaccine. At getbadnews.com you can
click 'About' for information, or just start playing the game- it's easy and
maybe even fun. You encounter mock Twitter (now X) fake news messages that
illustrate common strategies for making fake news memorable or believable.
You make choices between messages and decide which ones to 'forward' as you
try to spread fake news while building your credibility score and number of
'followers'-rather like real life for a conspiracy theorist wanting to spread
the word. Compete with your friends for credibility and number of followers.
Basol's online participants first saw 18 fictitious fake news tweets and
rated each for reliability (accuracy, believability), and also rated their
confidence in that reliability rating. Both ratings were on a 1 to 7 scale.
Those in the BadNews group then played the game for 15 minutes, whereas those
in the Control group played Tetris. Then all once again gave reliability and
confidence ratings for the 18 tweets.
decade earlier, had been one of several outside experts invited to scrutinize
the laboratory and experimental procedures of parapsychology researcher
Charles Honorton. Bem not only judged them adequate, but joined the research
effort and became a coauthor with Honorton. Bem and Honorton (1994) first
reviewed early ganzfeld studies and described how the experimental procedure
had been improved to reduce the chance that results could be influenced by
various possible biases, or leakages of information from sender to receiver.
For example, the randomization procedure was carried out automatically by
computer, and all stimuli were presented under computer control. Bem and
Honorton then presented data from studies conducted with the improved
procedure. Table 13.1 presents basic data from 10 studies reported by Bem and
Honorton (1994). Participants each made a single judgment, so in Pilot 1, for
example, 22 participants responded, with 8 of them giving a correct response.
Three pilot studies helped refine the procedures, then four studies used
novice receivers. Study 5 used 20 students of music, drama, or dance as
receivers, in response to suggestions that creative people might be more
likely to show telepathy. Studies 6 and 7 used receivers who had participated
in an earlier study. The proportion of hits expected by chance is .25, and
Table 13.1 shows that all but Study 1 found proportions higher than .25.

Some researchers claim that moral judgments are based not only on rational
considerations but also on one's current emotional state. To what extent can
recent emotional experiences influence moral judgments? Schnall et al. (2008)
examined this question by manipulating feelings of cleanliness and purity and
then observing the extent that this changes how harshly participants judge
the morality of others. Inscho Study 1, Schnall et al. asked participants to
complete a word scramble task with either neutral words (neutral prime) or
words related to cleanliness (cleanliness prime). All students then completed
a set of moral judgments about controversial scenarios: Moral judgment is the
average of six items, each rated on a scale from 0 to 9, with high meaning
harsh. The data from this study are in the Clean moral file, which also

performance. Their first study (Damisch 1) used a golf putting task. Students
in the experimental group were told they were using a lucky ball (the Lucky
group).  Calin-Jageman and Caldwell (2014) reported two studies designed to
replicate Damisch 1. The first (RCJ 1) followed Damisch 1 as closely as
practical, although the participants were American rather than German college
students. The second (RCJ 2) made several changes designed to increase any
effect of superstition on putting performance.
138 U.S. adults, recruited in August 2018 on Prolific Academic, worked
online. First, they saw six fake headlines four times, each time being asked
to rate how interesting/engaging/ funny/well-written the headline was. This
rating task simply ensured that the participants paid some attention to each
headline. The stimuli were 12 actual fake-news headlines about American
politics, with accompanying photographs. Half appealed to Republicans and
half to Democrats. Later, 12 fake headlines were presented one at a time, a
random mix of the six Old headlines-those seen before-and six New headlines
not seen previously. It was stated very clearly that independent,
non-partisan fact-checking had established that all the headlines were not
true. Participants first rated, on a 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely) scale,
the degree to which to which they judged it unethical to publish that
headline. That's the Unethicality DV. They also rated how likely they would
be to share the headline if they saw it posted by an acquaintance on social
media; there were three further similar ratings. Finally, they rated how
accurate they believed the headline to be.

To what extent does being exposed to the American flag influence political
attitudes? One seminal study (Carter et al., 2011) explored this issue by
subtly exposing participants either to images of the American flag or to
control images. Next, participants were asked about their political
attitudes, using a 1-7 rating scale where high scores indicate conservative
attitudes. Participants exposed to the flag were found to express
substantially more conservative attitudes. The Many Labs project replicated
this finding at 25 different locations in the United States.
mathematics? To investigate, Nosek et al. (2002) asked male and female
students to complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT)-this is a task
designed to measure a participant's implicit (non-conscious) feelings towards
a topic. (If you've never heard of the IAT, try it out here:
tiny.cc/harvardiat) On this IAT, students were tested for negative feelings
towards mathematics and art. Scores reflect the degree to which a student had
more negative implicit attitudes about mathematics than art (positive score:
more negative feelings about mathematics; 0: same level of negativity to
both; negative score: more negative feelings about art). data_gender_math_iat
has data from two labs that participated in a large-scale replication of the
original study (Klein et al., 2014a, 2014b)
al. (2002), in which male and female participants completed an Implicit
Association Test (IAT) that measured the extent of negative attitudes towards
mathematics, compared with art. The study found that women, compared with
men, tended to have more negative implicit attitudes towards mathematics. The
Many Labs project repeated this study at locations around the world (Klein et
al., 2014a, 2014b). Summary data for 30 of these labs are available in Gender
math IAT ma. Higher scores indicate more implicit bias against mathematics.

Could eating much less delay Alzheimer's? If so, that would be great news.
Halagappa et al. (2007) investigated the possibility by using a mouse model,
meaning they used Alzheimer-prone mice, which were genetically predisposed to
develop neural degeneration typical of Alzheimer's. The researchers used six
independent groups of mice, three tested in mouse middle age when 10 months
old, and three in mouse old age when 17 months. At each age there was a
control group of normal mice that ate freely (the NFree10 and NFree17
groups), a group of Alzheimer-prone mice that also ate freely (the AFree10
and AFree17 groups), and another Alzheimer-prone group restricted to 40% less
food than normal (the ADiet10 and ADiet17 groups). Table 14.2 lists the
factors that define the groups, and group labels. I'll discuss one measure of
mouse cognition: the percent time spent near the target of a water maze, with
higher values indicating better learning and memory. Table 14.2 reports the
means and standard deviations for this measure, and group sizes.

Suppose you want to change the battery in your phone, cook the perfect
souffle, or perform a three-ball juggle. Just as numerous people do every
day, you might search online to find a video that shows what to do. Suppose
you watch such a video just once. First question: How well would you then
predict you could perform the task? Second question: How well would you
actually perform the task, the first time you tried? Now suppose you watch
the video many times: Again consider the two questions. These questions were
investigated in a series of studies by Kardas and O'Brien (2018). Let's first
do some quick analyses of Kardas Experiments 3 and 4-let's call them Expt 3
and Expt 4-focusing on the effect of watching a video many times rather than
once. In Expt 3, participants first watched a brief video of a person
performing the moonwalk. The Low Exposure group watched the video once, the
High Exposure group 20 times. Then participants predicted, on a 1 to 10
scale, how well they felt they would be able to perform the moonwalk
themselves. Finally, they attempted a single performance of the moonwalk,
which was videoed. These videos were rated, on the same 1 to 10 scale, by
independent raters.

of the game and the scoring procedure. To play, you use your computer
trackpad to trace a target line, as accurately and quickly as you can. The
task is tricky because you can see only a mirror image of the path you are
tracing with a finger on the trackpad. A running score is displayed. The
final score is the percentage match between the target line and the path you
traced, so scores can range from 0 to 100
investigate, participants were asked to participate in a taste test. All
participants were actually given the same grape juice, but one glass was
poured from a bottle labeled 'Organic' and the other glass from a bottle
labeled 'Generic'. After each tasting (in counterbalanced order),
participants were asked to rate how much they enjoyed the juice on a scale
from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much). Participants were also asked to say
how much they'd be willing to pay for a large container of that juice on a
scale from $1 to $10. Load the Labels flavor data set from the book website.
These data were collected as part of a class project by Floretta-Schiller et

The researchers were interested in how different study approaches might
impact learning. Working in France, they created three independent groups,
each comprising 95 adults. Participants worked online through seven learning
modules about DNA. The Reread group worked through a module, then worked
through it a second time before going on to the next module. The Quiz group
worked through a module, then had to complete a quiz before going on to the
next module. The Prequiz group had to work through the quiz before seeing the
presentation of a module, then went on to the quiz and presentation of the
next module. Participants received feedback and a brief explanation after
answering each question in a quiz, and could take as long as they wished to
work through each module and quiz. Seven days later, participants completed a
final test.

worked sufficiently hard to develop the requisite skills? Meta-analysis of
correlations can help answer such questions. The issue here is the extent
that practice and effort may be sufficient for achieving the highest levels
of expertise. Ericsson et al. (1993) argued that years of effort is what
matters most: 'Many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent
are actually the result of intense practice extended for a minimum of 10
years' (p. 363). This view was enormously popularized by Malcolm Gladwell
(2008), who argued in his book Outliers that 10,000 hours of focused practice
is the key to achieving expertise. However, this view is now being
challenged, with one important contribution being a large meta-analysis of
correlations between amount of intense practice and level of achievement:
Macnamara et al. (2014) combined 157 correlations reported in a wide range of
fields, from sports to music and education, and found correlation of only r =
.35 .30, .39. Table 11.1 shows the 16 main correlations for music, from
Macnamara et al. (2014).
brightly colored areas indicating which brain regions are most active during
a particular type of cognition or emotion. Search online for fMRI (functional
magnetic resonance imaging) brain scans to see such pictures and learn how
they are made. They can be fascinating-are we at last able to see how
thinking works? In 2008, McCabe and Castel published studies that
investigated how adding a brain picture might alter judgments of the
credibility of a scientific article. For one group of participants, an
article was accompanied by a brain image that was irrelevant to the article.
For a second, independent group, there was no image. Participants read the
article, then gave a rating of the statement 'The scientific reasoning in the
article made sense'. The response options were 1 (strongly disagree), 2
(disagree), 3 (agree), and 4 (strongly agree). The researchers reported that
mean ratings were higher with a brain picture than without, but that the
difference was small. It seemed that an irrelevant brain picture may have
some, but only a small influence. The authors drew appropriately cautious
conclusions, but the result quickly attracted attention and there were many
media reports that greatly overstated it. At least according to the popular
media, it seemed that adding a brain picture made any story convincing.
Search on 'McCabe seeing is believing', or similar, to find media reports and
blog posts. Some warned readers to watch out for brain pictures, which, they
said, can trick you into believing things that aren't true. The result
intrigued some New Zealander colleagues of mine who discovered that, despite
its wide recognition, the finding hadn't been replicated. They ran
replication studies using the materials used by the original researchers, and
found generally small ESs. I joined the team at the data analysis stage and
the research was published (Michael et al., 2013). I'll discuss here a
meta-analysis of two of the original studies and eight replications by our
team. The studies were sufficiently similar for meta-analysis, especially
considering that all the Michael studies were designed to have many features
that matched the original studies.  This data set does not include
two additional critique studies run by the Michael team.  See also

(2011). People who wanted to reduce stress, and were not experienced
meditators, were assigned to a Meditation (n = 16) or a Control (n = 17)
group. The Meditation group participated in 8 weeks of intensive training and
practice of mindfulness meditation. The researchers used a questionnaire to
assess a range of emotional and cognitive variables both before (Pretest) and
after (Posttest) the 8-week period. All assessment was conducted while the
participants were not meditating. The study is notable for including brain
imaging to assess possible changes in participants' brains from Pretest to
Posttest. The researchers measured gray matter concentration, which increases
in brain regions that experience higher and more frequent activation. The
researchers expected that the hippocampus may be especially responsive to
meditation because it has been implicated in the regulation of emotion,
arousal, and general responsiveness. They therefore included in their planned
analysis the assessment of any changes to gray matter concentration in the
hippocampus.
To what extent might choosing organic foods make us morally smug? To
investigate, Eskine (2013) asked participants to rate images of organic food,
neutral (control) food, or comfort food. Next, under the guise of a different
study, all participants completed a moral judgment scale in which they read
different controversial scenarios and rated how morally wrong they judged
them to be (scale of 1-7, high judgments mean more wrong). Table 14.7 shows
summary data, which are also available in the first four variables in the
OrganicMoral file. In that file you can see two further variables, which
report full data-we'll come to these shortly. Here we use the summary data.
After the results of Eskine (2013) were published, Moery and Calin-Jageman
(2016) conducted a series of close replications. We obtained original
materials from Eskine, piloted the procedure, and preregistered our sampling
and analysis plan. The OSF page, osf.io/atkn7, has all the details. The data
from one of these close replications are in the last two variables of the
OrganicMoral file. For this replication study, group names are in the
variable ReplicationGroup and moral judgments in MoralJudgment. (You may need
to scroll right to see these variables.)
skills? To investigate, Burgmer and Englich (2012) assigned German
participants to either power or control conditions and then asked them to
play golf (Experiment 1) or darts (Experiment 2). They found that
participants manipulated to feel powerful performed substantially better than
those in the control condition. To study this finding further, Cusack et al.
(2015) conducted five replications in the United States. Across these
replications they tried different ways of manipulating power, different types
of tasks (golf, mirror tracing, and a cognitive task), different levels of
difficulty, and different types of participant pools (undergraduates and
online). Summary data from all seven studies are available in
PowerPerformance ma.
reassurance, or, instead, encouragement and challenge? Carol Dweck and her
colleagues have investigated many such questions about how people respond to
different types of feedback. My next example comes from Dweck's research
group and illustrates data analysis that starts with the full data, rather
than only summary statistics. Rattan et al. (2012) asked their college
student participants to imagine they were undertaking a mathematics course
and had just received a low score (65%) on the first test of the year.
Participants were assigned randomly into three groups, which received
different feedback along with the low score. The Comfort group received
positive encouragement and also reassurance, the Challenge group received
positive encouragement and also challenge, and the Control group received
just the positive encouragement. Participants then responded to a range of
questions about how they felt about the course and their professor. I'll
discuss data for their ratings of their own motivation toward mathematics,
made after they had received the feedback.
childhood? To investigate, a large international sample of children was asked
to play a game in which they were given 10 stickers but then asked if they
would give some of these stickers away to another child who had not been able
to be tested that day. The number of stickers donated was considered a
measure of altruistic sharing. In addition, the parents of each child
reported the family's religion. Summary data provided.

explanations of the material they are studying. Self-explaining has generally
been found to be more effective than standard studying, but it may also take
more time. This raises the question of whether it's the study strategy or the
extra time that benefits learning. To explore this issue, grade school
children took a pretest of mathematics conceptual knowledge, studied
mathematics problems, and then took a similar posttest (McEldoon et al.,
2013). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two study conditions:
normal study + more practice (More Practice group), or self-explaining
(Self-Explain group). The first condition was intended to make time spent
learning to be similar for the two groups. You can find part of the data from
this study in SelfExplain, the scores being percent correct.
program, and now it's your job to develop the ad campaign. Should you choose
a BeforeAfter pair of pictures, as in Figure 14.1, top panel? Or might a
Progressive sequence of pictures of the same person, as in the bottom panel,
be more effective? Pause, think, and discuss. Which would you choose, and
why? You might think that BeforeAfter is simpler and more dramatic. On the
other hand, Progressive highlights the steady improvement that you claim the
program will deliver. You're probably not surprised to learn that BeforeAfter
is used often and has long been a favorite of the advertising industry,
whereas Progressive is used only rarely. Luca Cian and colleagues (Cian et
al., 2020) were curious to know the extent to which BeforeAfter is actually
more effective, appealing, and credible than Progressive, or, indeed, whether
Progressive might score more highly. They reported seven studies of various
aspects of that question. I'll focus on their Study 2, in which they used
three independent groups to compare all three conditions illustrated in
Figure 14.1. The BeforeAfterInfo condition, in the middle panel, comprises
three BeforeAfter pairs, thus providing extra information about the before
and after endpoints. The researchers included this condition in case any
advantage of Progressive might stem simply from having more images, rather
than because it illustrates a clear progressive sequence. They randomly
assigned 213 participants from MTurk to one of the three groups. Participants
were asked to 'imagine that you have decided to lose some weight', then saw
one of the three ads for a weight loss program called MRMDiets. They then
answered the question 'How would you evaluate MRMDiets?' by choosing a 1-7
response on several scales, including Unlikeable-Likable,
Ineffective-Effective, and Not credible-Credible. The researchers averaged
six such scores to give an overall Credibility score, on the 1-7 scale, with
7 being the most credible. Simmons and Nelson (2020) were sufficiently
intrigued to carry out two substantial very close replications. With the
cooperation of the original researchers, they used the same materials and
procedure. They used much larger groups and preregistered their research
plan, including data analysis plan. I'll focus on their first replication, in
which 761 participants from MTurk were randomized to the three groups.
decided to examine the extent to which sleep relates to attractiveness. Each
of 70 college students self-reported the amount of sleep they had the night
before. In addition, a photograph was taken of each participant and rated for
attractiveness on a scale from 1 to 10 by two judges of the opposite gender.
The average rating score was used. You can download this data set (Sleep

Stickgold et al. (2000) found that, remarkably, performance on a visual
discrimination task actually improved over the 48-96 hours after initial
training, even without practice during that time. However, what if
participants were sleep deprived during that period? They trained 11
participants in that new skill, then all were sleep deprived. The data were

performance scores from immediately after training to after the night without
sleep: 0 represents no change, positive scores represent improvement, and
negative scores represent decline. Data set courtesy of

To what extent does study strategy influence learning? To investigate,
psychology students were randomly assigned to three groups and asked to learn
biology facts using one of three different strategies: a) Self-Explain
(explaining for each fact what new knowledge is gained and how it relates to
what is already known), b) Elab Interrogation (elaborative interrogation:
stating for each fact why it makes sense), or c) Repetition Control (stating
each fact over and over). After studying, students took a 25-point
fill-the-blank test (O'Reilly et al., 1998)
were interested in ways to enhance students' critical thinking. They were
investigating argument mapping, which is a promising way to use diagrams to
represent the structure of arguments. Students in their study completed an
established test of critical thinking (the Pretest), then a critical thinking
course based on argument mapping, then a second version of the test (the
Posttest).
might these factors cause aggressive behavior? To explore, Hilgard (2015)
asked male participants to play one of four versions of a video game for 15
minutes. The game was customized so that it could vary in violence (shooting
zombies or helping aliens) and difficulty (targets controlled by tough AI or
dumb AI). After the game, players were provoked by being given an insulting
evaluation by a confederate. Participants then got to decide how long the
confederate should hold their hand in painfully cold ice water (between 0 and
80 seconds), and this was taken as a measure of aggressive behavior. You can
find the materials and analysis plan for this study on the Open Science

examined this idea by collecting data on U.S. states. A Gallup poll in 2010
was used to measure each state's well-being index, a measure of mean
happiness for the state's residents on a scale from 0 to 100. Next, a kidney
donation database for 1999-2010 was used to figure out each state's rate

their classic study, Jacowitz and Kahneman (1995) asked participants to
estimate how many babies are born each day in the United States. Participants
were given either a low anchor (more than 100 babies/day) or a high anchor
(less than 50,000 babies/day). Those who saw the low anchor estimated many
fewer births/day than those who saw the high anchor, which suggests that the
wording can have a profound influence. The correct answer, as it happens, is
~11,000 births/day in 2014. To investigate the extent that these results are
replicable, the Many Labs project repeated this classic study at many
different labs around the world. You can find the summary data for 30 of
these labs in the Anchor Estimate ma data file
numerous other issues can be highly damaging, but are thriving in this social
media age. Trying to debunk a conspiracy theory by presenting facts and
evidence often doesn't work, alas. Psychological inoculation, also similar to
prebunking, presents a mild form of misinformation, preferably with
explanation, in the hope of building resistance to real-life fake news-a sort
of vaccine for fake news. The Bad News game is a spin-off from research on
psychological inoculation. Basol et al. (2020) assessed the possible
effectiveness of this game as a fake news vaccine. At getbadnews.com you can
click 'About' for information, or just start playing the game- it's easy and
maybe even fun. You encounter mock Twitter (now X) fake news messages that
illustrate common strategies for making fake news memorable or believable.
You make choices between messages and decide which ones to 'forward' as you
try to spread fake news while building your credibility score and number of
'followers'-rather like real life for a conspiracy theorist wanting to spread
the word. Compete with your friends for credibility and number of followers.
Basol's online participants first saw 18 fictitious fake news tweets and
rated each for reliability (accuracy, believability), and also rated their
confidence in that reliability rating. Both ratings were on a 1 to 7 scale.
Those in the BadNews group then played the game for 15 minutes, whereas those
in the Control group played Tetris. Then all once again gave reliability and
confidence ratings for the 18 tweets.
decade earlier, had been one of several outside experts invited to scrutinize
the laboratory and experimental procedures of parapsychology researcher
Charles Honorton. Bem not only judged them adequate, but joined the research
effort and became a coauthor with Honorton. Bem and Honorton (1994) first
reviewed early ganzfeld studies and described how the experimental procedure
had been improved to reduce the chance that results could be influenced by
various possible biases, or leakages of information from sender to receiver.
For example, the randomization procedure was carried out automatically by
computer, and all stimuli were presented under computer control. Bem and
Honorton then presented data from studies conducted with the improved
procedure. Table 13.1 presents basic data from 10 studies reported by Bem and
Honorton (1994). Participants each made a single judgment, so in Pilot 1, for
example, 22 participants responded, with 8 of them giving a correct response.
Three pilot studies helped refine the procedures, then four studies used
novice receivers. Study 5 used 20 students of music, drama, or dance as
receivers, in response to suggestions that creative people might be more
likely to show telepathy. Studies 6 and 7 used receivers who had participated
in an earlier study. The proportion of hits expected by chance is .25, and
Table 13.1 shows that all but Study 1 found proportions higher than .25.

Some researchers claim that moral judgments are based not only on rational
considerations but also on one's current emotional state. To what extent can
recent emotional experiences influence moral judgments? Schnall et al. (2008)
examined this question by manipulating feelings of cleanliness and purity and
then observing the extent that this changes how harshly participants judge
the morality of others. Inscho Study 1, Schnall et al. asked participants to
complete a word scramble task with either neutral words (neutral prime) or
words related to cleanliness (cleanliness prime). All students then completed
a set of moral judgments about controversial scenarios: Moral judgment is the
average of six items, each rated on a scale from 0 to 9, with high meaning
harsh. The data from this study are in the Clean moral file, which also
contains data from a replication by Johnson et al. (2014)</h1>

performance. Their first study (Damisch 1) used a golf putting task. Students
in the experimental group were told they were using a lucky ball (the Lucky
group).  Calin-Jageman and Caldwell (2014) reported two studies designed to
replicate Damisch 1. The first (RCJ 1) followed Damisch 1 as closely as
practical, although the participants were American rather than German college
students. The second (RCJ 2) made several changes designed to increase any
effect of superstition on putting performance.
138 U.S. adults, recruited in August 2018 on Prolific Academic, worked
online. First, they saw six fake headlines four times, each time being asked
to rate how interesting/engaging/ funny/well-written the headline was. This
rating task simply ensured that the participants paid some attention to each
headline. The stimuli were 12 actual fake-news headlines about American
politics, with accompanying photographs. Half appealed to Republicans and
half to Democrats. Later, 12 fake headlines were presented one at a time, a
random mix of the six Old headlines-those seen before-and six New headlines
not seen previously. It was stated very clearly that independent,
non-partisan fact-checking had established that all the headlines were not
true. Participants first rated, on a 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely) scale,
the degree to which to which they judged it unethical to publish that
headline. That's the Unethicality DV. They also rated how likely they would
be to share the headline if they saw it posted by an acquaintance on social
media; there were three further similar ratings. Finally, they rated how
accurate they believed the headline to be.
your heart rate? To investigate, Lakens (2013) asked students to record their
heart rate (in beats per minute) at rest before (baseline) and then while
recalling a time of intense anger. This is a conceptual replication of a

To what extent does being exposed to the American flag influence political
attitudes? One seminal study (Carter et al., 2011) explored this issue by
subtly exposing participants either to images of the American flag or to
control images. Next, participants were asked about their political
attitudes, using a 1-7 rating scale where high scores indicate conservative
attitudes. Participants exposed to the flag were found to express
substantially more conservative attitudes. The Many Labs project replicated
this finding at 25 different locations in the United States.
mathematics? To investigate, Nosek et al. (2002) asked male and female
students to complete an Implicit Association Test (IAT)-this is a task
designed to measure a participant's implicit (non-conscious) feelings towards
a topic. (If you've never heard of the IAT, try it out here:
tiny.cc/harvardiat) On this IAT, students were tested for negative feelings
towards mathematics and art. Scores reflect the degree to which a student had
more negative implicit attitudes about mathematics than art (positive score:
more negative feelings about mathematics; 0: same level of negativity to
both; negative score: more negative feelings about art). data_gender_math_iat
has data from two labs that participated in a large-scale replication of the
original study (Klein et al., 2014a, 2014b)
al. (2002), in which male and female participants completed an Implicit
Association Test (IAT) that measured the extent of negative attitudes towards
mathematics, compared with art. The study found that women, compared with
men, tended to have more negative implicit attitudes towards mathematics. The
Many Labs project repeated this study at locations around the world (Klein et
al., 2014a, 2014b). Summary data for 30 of these labs are available in Gender
math IAT ma. Higher scores indicate more implicit bias against mathematics.

Could eating much less delay Alzheimer's? If so, that would be great news.
Halagappa et al. (2007) investigated the possibility by using a mouse model,
meaning they used Alzheimer-prone mice, which were genetically predisposed to
develop neural degeneration typical of Alzheimer's. The researchers used six
independent groups of mice, three tested in mouse middle age when 10 months
old, and three in mouse old age when 17 months. At each age there was a
control group of normal mice that ate freely (the NFree10 and NFree17
groups), a group of Alzheimer-prone mice that also ate freely (the AFree10
and AFree17 groups), and another Alzheimer-prone group restricted to 40% less
food than normal (the ADiet10 and ADiet17 groups). Table 14.2 lists the
factors that define the groups, and group labels. I'll discuss one measure of
mouse cognition: the percent time spent near the target of a water maze, with
higher values indicating better learning and memory. Table 14.2 reports the
means and standard deviations for this measure, and group sizes.

Suppose you want to change the battery in your phone, cook the perfect
souffle, or perform a three-ball juggle. Just as numerous people do every
day, you might search online to find a video that shows what to do. Suppose
you watch such a video just once. First question: How well would you then
predict you could perform the task? Second question: How well would you
actually perform the task, the first time you tried? Now suppose you watch
the video many times: Again consider the two questions. These questions were
investigated in a series of studies by Kardas and O'Brien (2018). Let's first
do some quick analyses of Kardas Experiments 3 and 4-let's call them Expt 3
and Expt 4-focusing on the effect of watching a video many times rather than
once. In Expt 3, participants first watched a brief video of a person
performing the moonwalk. The Low Exposure group watched the video once, the
High Exposure group 20 times. Then participants predicted, on a 1 to 10
scale, how well they felt they would be able to perform the moonwalk
themselves. Finally, they attempted a single performance of the moonwalk,
which was videoed. These videos were rated, on the same 1 to 10 scale, by
independent raters.

Mechanical Turk, who are typically more diverse than students. The online
task was based on a mirror-drawing game developed by Bob and students (Cusack
et al., 2015, tiny.cc/bobmirrortrace). Participants first read a description
of the game and the scoring procedure. To play, you use your computer
trackpad to trace a target line, as accurately and quickly as you can. The
task is tricky because you can see only a mirror image of the path you are
tracing with a finger on the trackpad. A running score is displayed. The
final score is the percentage match between the target line and the path you
traced, so scores can range from 0 to 100
investigate, participants were asked to participate in a taste test. All
participants were actually given the same grape juice, but one glass was
poured from a bottle labeled 'Organic' and the other glass from a bottle
labeled 'Generic'. After each tasting (in counterbalanced order),
participants were asked to rate how much they enjoyed the juice on a scale
from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much). Participants were also asked to say
how much they'd be willing to pay for a large container of that juice on a
scale from $1 to $10. Load the Labels flavor data set from the book website.
These data were collected as part of a class project by Floretta-Schiller et
al. (2015), whose work was inspired by a very clever study looking at the
effects of fast-food wrappers on children's enjoyment of food (Robinson et
al., 2007).
The researchers were interested in how different study approaches might
impact learning. Working in France, they created three independent groups,
each comprising 95 adults. Participants worked online through seven learning
modules about DNA. The Reread group worked through a module, then worked
through it a second time before going on to the next module. The Quiz group
worked through a module, then had to complete a quiz before going on to the
next module. The Prequiz group had to work through the quiz before seeing the
presentation of a module, then went on to the quiz and presentation of the
next module. Participants received feedback and a brief explanation after
answering each question in a quiz, and could take as long as they wished to
work through each module and quiz. Seven days later, participants completed a
final test.

worked sufficiently hard to develop the requisite skills? Meta-analysis of
correlations can help answer such questions. The issue here is the extent
that practice and effort may be sufficient for achieving the highest levels
of expertise. Ericsson et al. (1993) argued that years of effort is what
matters most: 'Many characteristics once believed to reflect innate talent
are actually the result of intense practice extended for a minimum of 10
years' (p. 363). This view was enormously popularized by Malcolm Gladwell
(2008), who argued in his book Outliers that 10,000 hours of focused practice
is the key to achieving expertise. However, this view is now being
challenged, with one important contribution being a large meta-analysis of
correlations between amount of intense practice and level of achievement:
Macnamara et al. (2014) combined 157 correlations reported in a wide range of
fields, from sports to music and education, and found correlation of only r =
.35 .30, .39. Table 11.1 shows the 16 main correlations for music, from
Macnamara et al. (2014).
brightly colored areas indicating which brain regions are most active during
a particular type of cognition or emotion. Search online for fMRI (functional
magnetic resonance imaging) brain scans to see such pictures and learn how
they are made. They can be fascinating-are we at last able to see how
thinking works? In 2008, McCabe and Castel published studies that
investigated how adding a brain picture might alter judgments of the
credibility of a scientific article. For one group of participants, an
article was accompanied by a brain image that was irrelevant to the article.
For a second, independent group, there was no image. Participants read the
article, then gave a rating of the statement 'The scientific reasoning in the
article made sense'. The response options were 1 (strongly disagree), 2
(disagree), 3 (agree), and 4 (strongly agree). The researchers reported that
mean ratings were higher with a brain picture than without, but that the
difference was small. It seemed that an irrelevant brain picture may have
some, but only a small influence. The authors drew appropriately cautious
conclusions, but the result quickly attracted attention and there were many
media reports that greatly overstated it. At least according to the popular
media, it seemed that adding a brain picture made any story convincing.
Search on 'McCabe seeing is believing', or similar, to find media reports and
blog posts. Some warned readers to watch out for brain pictures, which, they
said, can trick you into believing things that aren't true. The result
intrigued some New Zealander colleagues of mine who discovered that, despite
its wide recognition, the finding hadn't been replicated. They ran
replication studies using the materials used by the original researchers, and
found generally small ESs. I joined the team at the data analysis stage and
the research was published (Michael et al., 2013). I'll discuss here a
meta-analysis of two of the original studies and eight replications by our
team. The studies were sufficiently similar for meta-analysis, especially
considering that all the Michael studies were designed to have many features
that matched the original studies.  This data set does <em>not</em> include
two additional critique studies run by the Michael team.  See also

(2011). People who wanted to reduce stress, and were not experienced
meditators, were assigned to a Meditation (n = 16) or a Control (n = 17)
group. The Meditation group participated in 8 weeks of intensive training and
practice of mindfulness meditation. The researchers used a questionnaire to
assess a range of emotional and cognitive variables both before (Pretest) and
after (Posttest) the 8-week period. All assessment was conducted while the
participants were not meditating. The study is notable for including brain
imaging to assess possible changes in participants' brains from Pretest to
Posttest. The researchers measured gray matter concentration, which increases
in brain regions that experience higher and more frequent activation. The
researchers expected that the hippocampus may be especially responsive to
meditation because it has been implicated in the regulation of emotion,
arousal, and general responsiveness. They therefore included in their planned
analysis the assessment of any changes to gray matter concentration in the
hippocampus.
To what extent might choosing organic foods make us morally smug? To
investigate, Eskine (2013) asked participants to rate images of organic food,
neutral (control) food, or comfort food. Next, under the guise of a different
study, all participants completed a moral judgment scale in which they read
different controversial scenarios and rated how morally wrong they judged
them to be (scale of 1-7, high judgments mean more wrong). Table 14.7 shows
summary data, which are also available in the first four variables in the
OrganicMoral file. In that file you can see two further variables, which
report full data-we'll come to these shortly. Here we use the summary data.
After the results of Eskine (2013) were published, Moery and Calin-Jageman
(2016) conducted a series of close replications. We obtained original
materials from Eskine, piloted the procedure, and preregistered our sampling
and analysis plan. The OSF page, osf.io/atkn7, has all the details. The data
from one of these close replications are in the last two variables of the
OrganicMoral file. For this replication study, group names are in the
variable ReplicationGroup and moral judgments in MoralJudgment. (You may need
to scroll right to see these variables.)
skills? To investigate, Burgmer and Englich (2012) assigned German
participants to either power or control conditions and then asked them to
play golf (Experiment 1) or darts (Experiment 2). They found that
participants manipulated to feel powerful performed substantially better than
those in the control condition. To study this finding further, Cusack et al.
(2015) conducted five replications in the United States. Across these
replications they tried different ways of manipulating power, different types
of tasks (golf, mirror tracing, and a cognitive task), different levels of
difficulty, and different types of participant pools (undergraduates and
online). Summary data from all seven studies are available in
PowerPerformance ma.
reassurance, or, instead, encouragement and challenge? Carol Dweck and her
colleagues have investigated many such questions about how people respond to
different types of feedback. My next example comes from Dweck's research
group and illustrates data analysis that starts with the full data, rather
than only summary statistics. Rattan et al. (2012) asked their college
student participants to imagine they were undertaking a mathematics course
and had just received a low score (65%) on the first test of the year.
Participants were assigned randomly into three groups, which received
different feedback along with the low score. The Comfort group received
positive encouragement and also reassurance, the Challenge group received
positive encouragement and also challenge, and the Control group received
just the positive encouragement. Participants then responded to a range of
questions about how they felt about the course and their professor. I'll
discuss data for their ratings of their own motivation toward mathematics,
made after they had received the feedback.
childhood? To investigate, a large international sample of children was asked
to play a game in which they were given 10 stickers but then asked if they
would give some of these stickers away to another child who had not been able
to be tested that day. The number of stickers donated was considered a
measure of altruistic sharing. In addition, the parents of each child
reported the family's religion. Summary data provided.
has data from a large online survey in which participants were asked to

was also reported.
explanations of the material they are studying. Self-explaining has generally
been found to be more effective than standard studying, but it may also take
more time. This raises the question of whether it's the study strategy or the
extra time that benefits learning. To explore this issue, grade school
children took a pretest of mathematics conceptual knowledge, studied
mathematics problems, and then took a similar posttest (McEldoon et al.,
2013). Participants were randomly assigned to one of two study conditions:
normal study + more practice (More Practice group), or self-explaining
(Self-Explain group). The first condition was intended to make time spent
learning to be similar for the two groups. You can find part of the data from
this study in SelfExplain, the scores being percent correct.
program, and now it's your job to develop the ad campaign. Should you choose
a BeforeAfter pair of pictures, as in Figure 14.1, top panel? Or might a
Progressive sequence of pictures of the same person, as in the bottom panel,
be more effective? Pause, think, and discuss. Which would you choose, and
why? You might think that BeforeAfter is simpler and more dramatic. On the
other hand, Progressive highlights the steady improvement that you claim the
program will deliver. You're probably not surprised to learn that BeforeAfter
is used often and has long been a favorite of the advertising industry,
whereas Progressive is used only rarely. Luca Cian and colleagues (Cian et
al., 2020) were curious to know the extent to which BeforeAfter is actually
more effective, appealing, and credible than Progressive, or, indeed, whether
Progressive might score more highly. They reported seven studies of various
aspects of that question. I'll focus on their Study 2, in which they used
three independent groups to compare all three conditions illustrated in
Figure 14.1. The BeforeAfterInfo condition, in the middle panel, comprises
three BeforeAfter pairs, thus providing extra information about the before
and after endpoints. The researchers included this condition in case any
advantage of Progressive might stem simply from having more images, rather
than because it illustrates a clear progressive sequence. They randomly
assigned 213 participants from MTurk to one of the three groups. Participants
were asked to 'imagine that you have decided to lose some weight', then saw
one of the three ads for a weight loss program called MRMDiets. They then
answered the question 'How would you evaluate MRMDiets?' by choosing a 1-7
response on several scales, including Unlikeable-Likable,
Ineffective-Effective, and Not credible-Credible. The researchers averaged
six such scores to give an overall Credibility score, on the 1-7 scale, with
7 being the most credible. Simmons and Nelson (2020) were sufficiently
intrigued to carry out two substantial very close replications. With the
cooperation of the original researchers, they used the same materials and
procedure. They used much larger groups and preregistered their research
plan, including data analysis plan. I'll focus on their first replication, in
which 761 participants from MTurk were randomized to the three groups.
decided to examine the extent to which sleep relates to attractiveness. Each
of 70 college students self-reported the amount of sleep they had the night
before. In addition, a photograph was taken of each participant and rated for
attractiveness on a scale from 1 to 10 by two judges of the opposite gender.
The average rating score was used. You can download this data set (Sleep
Beauty) from the book website.
Stickgold et al. (2000) found that, remarkably, performance on a visual
discrimination task actually improved over the 48-96 hours after initial
training, even without practice during that time. However, what if
participants were sleep deprived during that period? They trained 11
participants in that new skill, then all were sleep deprived. The data were
(-14.7, -10.7, -10.7, 2.2, 2.4, 4.5, 7.2, 9.6, 10, 21.3, 21.8)-or download
the Stickgold data set from the book website. The data are the changes in

To what extent does study strategy influence learning? To investigate,
psychology students were randomly assigned to three groups and asked to learn
biology facts using one of three different strategies: a) Self-Explain
(explaining for each fact what new knowledge is gained and how it relates to
what is already known), b) Elab Interrogation (elaborative interrogation:
stating for each fact why it makes sense), or c) Repetition Control (stating
each fact over and over). After studying, students took a 25-point
fill-the-blank test (O'Reilly et al., 1998)
were interested in ways to enhance students' critical thinking. They were
investigating argument mapping, which is a promising way to use diagrams to
represent the structure of arguments. Students in their study completed an
established test of critical thinking (the Pretest), then a critical thinking
course based on argument mapping, then a second version of the test (the
Posttest).
might these factors cause aggressive behavior? To explore, Hilgard (2015)
asked male participants to play one of four versions of a video game for 15
minutes. The game was customized so that it could vary in violence (shooting
zombies or helping aliens) and difficulty (targets controlled by tough AI or
dumb AI). After the game, players were provoked by being given an insulting
evaluation by a confederate. Participants then got to decide how long the
confederate should hold their hand in painfully cold ice water (between 0 and
80 seconds), and this was taken as a measure of aggressive behavior. You can

Framework: osf. io/cwenz. This is a simplified version of the full data set.</p>
