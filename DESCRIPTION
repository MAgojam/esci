Title: Estimation Statistics with Confidence Intervals
Version: 1.0.2

Description: An r package and 'jamovi' module for the estimation approach 
    to inferential statistics, the approach which emphasizes effect sizes, 
    interval estimates, and meta-analysis. Nearly all functions
    are based on 'statpsych' or 'metafor'.  This package is still under active
    development, and breaking changes are likely, especially with the
    plot and hypothesis test functions.  If you need a stable and
    production-ready approach for confidence intervals, use
    'statpsych'.
